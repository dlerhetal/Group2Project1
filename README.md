Dale, Josh, Ilknur, Hugo

In this project, our team wanted to study Nashville traffic over the course of the last 5 years. One observation from our team was that Thursdays felt as though they had become busier; even busier than other days. In this study, we broke down traffic by year, by month per year, by day of the week, and even by the time of day. Additionally, we wanted to see if other factors affected our commuting experience such as population increase and accidents/road emergencies. With limited time, money, and resources, we were able to pull valuable information about the traffic trends of Metro Nashville.
